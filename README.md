🏨 Hotel Reservation System

A Java-based Hotel Reservation System where customers can explore available rooms, create an account, and manage their reservations. Admins have complete control over rooms, customers, and reservations. The system is designed with OOP principles and robust exception handling to ensure smooth execution without crashes.
